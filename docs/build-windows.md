# Building H3-Java on Windows

Building H3-Java on Windows requires the following dependencies:

* JDK 8
* Maven
* CMake
* Git for Windows
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017

The built library will support 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems only. Build instructions are the same as other platforms: `mvn package` to build the JAR, and `mvn install` to install locally.
